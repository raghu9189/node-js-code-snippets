### **Worker Threads in Node.js**
The **Worker Threads** module in Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code in separate threads. This helps to **execute CPU-intensive tasks** without blocking the main event loop.

---

### **Why Use Worker Threads?**
By default, Node.js runs **on a single thread**. While it's great for handling multiple I/O operations (like database queries, API calls), it's **not efficient** for CPU-heavy tasks like:
- Image processing  
- Data encryption  
- Large computations  

With **Worker Threads**, we can create multiple threads to handle such tasks **without freezing** the main thread.

---

### **Basic Example of Worker Threads**
```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
    console.log("Main thread is running...");

    // Creating a worker thread
    const worker = new Worker(__filename);

    // Listen for messages from the worker
    worker.on('message', (message) => {
        console.log(`Received from worker: ${message}`);
    });

    // Send a message to the worker
    worker.postMessage("Hello from main thread!");
} else {
    // Worker thread logic
    console.log("Worker thread started");

    // Listen for messages from the main thread
    parentPort.on('message', (message) => {
        console.log(`Worker received: ${message}`);
        parentPort.postMessage("Hello from worker thread!");
    });
}
```

---

### **How This Works**
1. The **Main Thread** (`isMainThread === true`):
   - Starts first and creates a **Worker Thread**.
   - Sends a message to the Worker.

2. The **Worker Thread** (`isMainThread === false`):
   - Runs separately and listens for messages from the Main Thread.
   - Replies back to the Main Thread.

---

### **Running CPU-Intensive Tasks**
Let's say we have a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence:

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
    console.log("Main thread is running...");

    // Create a new worker for heavy computation
    const worker = new Worker(__filename, { workerData: 40 });

    worker.on('message', (result) => {
        console.log(`Fibonacci result: ${result}`);
    });

} else {
    function fibonacci(n) {
        return n <= 1 ? n : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

    // Perform computation and send result back
    const result = fibonacci(workerData);
    parentPort.postMessage(result);
}
```

### **Why Use This?**
âœ… **Doesn't block** the main thread.  
âœ… Can run **multiple workers** in parallel.  
âœ… Great for **CPU-heavy tasks** that slow down the event loop.

### **When to Use Worker Threads?**
- **Heavy computations** (e.g., cryptography, data analysis).
- **Large file processing** (e.g., image/video conversion).
- **Parallel tasks** that need full CPU utilization.

If your task involves **I/O operations**, use **clustering** instead, as Worker Threads are meant for **CPU-intensive** work.
