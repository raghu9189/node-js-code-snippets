NPM, or Node Package Manager, is a free, open-source tool that helps developers manage JavaScript packages. It's used to find, build, and manage code packages, and to handle dependencies. [1, 2, 3]  
Advantages of NPM [4]  

• Faster development: NPM provides access to a large library of packages and modules, which can save developers time and effort [4]  
• Easy package management: NPM makes it easy to search for and install packages [4]  
• Code sharing: NPM provides a platform for sharing and distributing code, which can promote collaboration [4]  
• Local package installation: NPM allows you to install packages locally, which can help save on space [2]  
• Reduces development time: NPM can help reduce development time by allowing you to install the exact modules you need [2]  

How NPM works [2]  

• NPM is installed with Node.js [2]  
• NPM provides command-line tools to help you install packages and manage their dependencies [3]  
• NPM automatically generates a package-lock.json file that records the exact versions of dependencies installed in your project [5]  

Some drawbacks of NPM [6]  

• Installing tools globally with NPM can lead to version conflicts between different projects 
• In some cases, package installations may be slower compared to alternatives like Yarn
