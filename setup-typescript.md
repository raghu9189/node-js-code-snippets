### **Method 1: Formal and Traditional Setup**

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
2. **Create a `src/index.ts` main file**, then install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i --save-dev typescript
   npm i --save-dev @types/node
   ```
3. **[Alternative] Generate `tsconfig.json`**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --init
   ```
   This creates a `tsconfig.json` file with default configuration values.

4. **[Alternative] Compile a single file manually**:
   ```bash
   tsc index.ts
   ```
   This generates `index.js` from `index.ts`.  
   **Note:** Node.js only understands JavaScript, so you need to run:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Important**: We need to compile (transpile) TypeScript to JavaScript before Node.js can execute it.

6. **Create a `dist` directory** (distributable folder).

7. **Update `tsconfig.json`**:
   - Set the `"outDir"` property to:
     ```json
     "outDir": "./dist/"
     ```
   - Uncomment the line if it's commented out.

8. **Compile TypeScript files**:
   ```bash
   tsc
   ```
   This generates the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

9. **Run the compiled JavaScript code**:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

10. **Automate the process with `package.json`**:
    Add a script in `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "tsc && node dist/index.js"
    }
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

### **Explanation**:
- We are compiling TypeScript into JavaScript and running the compiled JavaScript code.
- Writing code in TypeScript ensures type safety during development, which is the key goal.
- This process is called **precompiling** with `tsc`.

---

### **Note**:
- **Node.js only understands JavaScript.**
- ðŸ’¥ In a TypeScript project, `typescript` is typically added as a **dev dependency** because it is only needed during development for type checking and transpiling. It is not required at runtime.

---

### **Method 2: Setup with `ts-node` (Faster Development Workflow)**

1. **Install `ts-node` package**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev ts-node
   ```
2. **Add a script in `package.json`**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
      "start": "ts-node src/index.ts"
   }
   ```
3. **Run the project directly without manual compilation**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
